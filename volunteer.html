			<h1>Volunteer</h1>
			<p>Onan's Pet Adoptions is a 100% volunteer effort managed and run by dedicated individuals who love animals and understand the incredible role they play in our lives! If you have a particular talent that would be of assistance to us let us know or if you just love animals, we can always use your help!</p>
			<p>As a non-profit, Castaway Pet Rescue relies on fundraising and donations to support our efforts on behalf of homeless animals. Volunteers are needed to help with fundraising by assisting in a variety of fundraising efforts throughout the year.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in volunteering, please call us at <a href="tel:1234567890">(123) 456-7890</a></p>

			<h1>Volunteer</h1>
			<p>There are several ways in which you can volunteer with Onan's Pet Adoptions and we invite you to come meet us, meet the dogs, find out what we are about, and join our “family”. I can guarantee you will fall in love with our doggies and enjoy the camaraderie of the other volunteers who are sharing their time making a difference in these animals’ lives. We believe everyone has something to offer which can help our animals, and we need you! Rescue is a Team effort!</p>
			<p>Most Saturdays, we hold adoption events, providing an opportunity for our dogs to meet their forever families. At these events, we ask our volunteers to hold a leash and interact with potential adopters with guidance provided by our experienced volunteers or interviewers. Fundraising is essential to the care and maintenance of our dogs and we have events planned throughout the year. We very much rely on the help of volunteers at these events!</p>
