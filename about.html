			<h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
			<p>Onan's Pet Adoptions, a premier companion animal resource community, is committed to promoting the animal-human bond and nurturing relationships with companion animals which are guided by compassion.</p>
			<p>We are dedicated to rescuing dogs left homeless for whatever reason â€“ dogs in public shelters where they are at high risk of euthanasia due to pet overpopulation, dogs given up by their owners because of difficult circumstances, and those in danger of abuse or neglect.</p>

			<h1>Mission and Vision</h1>
			<p>The mission and vision for Onan's Pet Adoptions is to save dogs and cats, of all sizes and all breeds by placing them into loving, forever homes. We are an all-volunteer dog rescue organization based in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
			<p>We are committed to providing the dogs that come into Onan's Pet Adoptions with the best possible care while they wait for their forever homes by acclimating them and providing the appropriate veterinary care needed.</p>
			<p>We also serve our community and adopters by educating and encouraging responsible pet ownership with an emphasis on the need for spaying and neutering. And while we spend our time focused on this mission, we also choose to create a compassionate, humane and healthy workplace for ourselves and each other.</p>
			<P>Our purpose is to ensure the best possible quality of life for all animals, and to promote respect and reverence for life by establishing a "no kill" philosophy. Establish and maintain a fiscally-responsible shelter for rescued, abandoned, abused or neglected animals and promote the adoption of rescued, abandoned, abused or neglected animals into safe, lifelong homes.</p>
