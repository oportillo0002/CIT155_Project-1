			<h1>Adoptions</h1>
			<p>It's not just about placing the dog as quickly as possible but ensuring that the dog, and the new loving family, has a lifelong happy match. So, please be patient in this process and feel free to contact us with any questions. We want you to have a wonderful new best friend and we will spend the time with the dog, and you to ensure this happy match.</p>
			<p>With good care, most dogs can live 12 to 15 years and most cats can live 15 to 20 years, so it is critical that you consider what is likely to be happening in your own life over the next 15 to 20 years — before you adopt a pet.</p>
			<h2>Volunteer Opportunities Available</h2>

			<h1>Adoptions</h1>
			<p>Our love and dedication is to find the best possible home for our surrendered pets. It's not just about placing the dog as quickly as possible but ensuring that the dog, and the new loving family, has a lifelong happy match. So, please be patient in this process and feel free to contact us with any questions. We want you to have a wonderful new best friend and we will spend the time with the dog, and you to ensure this happy match.</p>
			<p>We have new animals arriving daily with no prior health history. We have a veterinarian on staff and we do our best to ensure that the pets we adopt are healthy. With good care, most dogs can live 12 to 15 years and most cats can live 15 to 20 years, so it is critical that you consider what is likely to be happening in your own life over the next 15 to 20 years — before you adopt a pet.</p>
			<p>Please come see our loving pets or give us a call, <a href="tel:1234567890">(123) 456-7890</a></p>
